# Sudoku-Search-Project

Must install sudoku library before running game.py
```
# Python 2
pip install py-sudoku

# Python 3
pip3 install py-sudoku
```
(game.py)

Project 1 for CISC 3410 (Artificial Intelligence). Implementation of four searches DFS, BFS, DFS with pruning, and BFS with pruning, which are used to find the correct Sudoku board. There are eight tests for 2x2 boards, each with a different difficulty (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). Changing the difficulty refers to increasing the amount of whitespaces. There's two more test cases, where the size of the board changes (3x3 and 4x4). A timer is set in the beginning of each method, and is returned once the search is complete to comapre the efficiency of each search.

Must install matplotlib in order run graph.py
```
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```

(graph.py)

After running game.py ten times, i collected the time's of each of the searches in order to compare how long it took each search to complete.

Currently, I'm having issues with the searches continuing for most of the test cases. I will return to the project when I have more time available.
